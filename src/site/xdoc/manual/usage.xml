      <subsection name="Static vs Non-Static Loggers">
        <p>As with any variable in Java, Loggers may be declared as static variables or class member variables. However,
        there are a few factors to consider when choosing to delare a logger as static vs non-static. Generally, it
        is better to declare Loggers as static.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Instantiation of a new Logger is a fairly expensive operation when using the default ContextSelector,
            <a class="javadoc" href="../log4j-core/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/selector/ClassLoaderContextSelector.html">ClassLoaderContextSelector</a>.
            When the Logger is created the <code>ClassLoaderContextSelector</code> will locate the ClassLoader for the Class the Logger
            is associated with and add the Logger to the LoggerContext associated with that ClassLoader.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once a Logger is created it will not be deleted until the <code>LoggerContext</code> it is associated with
            is deleted. Typically, this will only happen when the application is shut down or un-deployed. Each call
            to getLogger with the same logger name will return the same Logger instance. Thus, there is very little
            difference between a static or non-static Logger.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no behavioral difference between a static and non-static Logger. Both will have the Logger name
            assigned when they are created, which usually will be the name of the class they are associated with. See
            the discussion below on logger names vs class names and the example for more information.
          </li>
        </ol>
         </p>

      <a name="LoggerVsClass"/>
      <subsection name="Logging the Logger name vs the Class name">
        <p>
          The logger name of a Logger is specified when the Logger is created. When a log method is called the
          class name value in the log event will reflect the name of the class the log method was called from, which is
          not necessarily the same as the class that created the Logger. The following example illustrations this.
        </p>

        <p>The base class creates a static Logger and a logger variable that is initialized as that same Logger.
          It has two methods that perform logging, once that uses the static logger and one that uses a Logger that
          can be overridden.
        </p>

        <p>
          This class extends the base class. It provides its own logger and has two methods, one that uses the
          logger in this class and one that uses the static logger from the base class.
        </p>

      public void log2(Marker marker) {
          LOGGER.debug(marker,"MySuperClass logger message from MyClass");
      }
  }
</pre>
      <p>
        The application exercises all the logging methods four times. The first two times the Logger in the base
        class is set to the static Logger. The second two times the Logger in the base class is set to use the
        Logger in the subclass. In the first and third invocation of each method a null Marker is passed. In the
        second and fourth a Marker named "CLASS" is passed.
      </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  package org.apache.logging;

  import org.apache.logging.log4j.Marker;
  import org.apache.logging.log4j.MarkerManager;

  public class App {

      public static void main( String[] args ) {
          Marker marker = MarkerManager.getMarker("CLASS");
          MyClass myclass = new MyClass();

          System.out.println("------- MySuperClass Logger ----------");
          myclass.demoLog(null);
          myclass.demoLog(marker);

          myclass.demoLog(null);

          myclass.log2(null);
          myclass.log2(marker);
      }
  }</pre>

      <p>
        The configuration takes advantage of Log4j's ability to select a pattern based upon attributes of the log event.
        In this case %C, the class name pattern, is used when the CLASS Marker is present, and %c, the logger name
        is used when the CLASS marker is not present.

          The output below illustrates the difference between using the Logger name and the Class name in the pattern. All
          the odd numbered items print the name of the logger (%c) while all the even numbered items print the
          name of the class that called the logging method (%C). The numbers in the description of the outcomes in the
          following list match the corresponding numbers shown in the output.
          <ol>

              the method was called against the MyClass instance it is implemented in MySuperClass so that is what

            <li>Logging is performed in the subclass using the logger in the subclass, so the name of the
              subclass is printed as the logger name.</li>

              is printed since that is where the method exists.</li>

        <p>
          In the example above there are two Loggers declared. One is static and one is non-static. When looking at
          the results it is clear that the outcomes would be exactly the same regardless of whether how the loggers
          are declared. The name of the logger will always originate from the class in which it is created and the
          Class name in each log event will always reflect the Class from which the logging method was called.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that there is a substantial performance penalty for printing the location information
          (class name, method name, and line number). If the method name and line number are not important it is
          usually better to make sure that each class has its own Logger so the logger name accurately reflects the
          class performing the logging.
