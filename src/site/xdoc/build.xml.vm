      <subsection name="Building">
        <p>
          Log4j 2.x is hosted in the Apache Software Foundation's subversion repository. Details on obtaining the
          most current source code can be found at
          <a href="./source-repository.html">Log4j Source Repository</a>. The source from the latest release may be
          obtained by downloading it using the instructions at <a href="./download.html">Log4j Downloads</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Log4j 2.x uses Maven 2 or 3 as its build tool. To build Log4j simply run "mvn install" from the root
          directory. Then to build the site, run "mvn site". To rebuild only what's changed and execute the tests, run
          "mvn test". To rebuild from scratch, add "clean", for example: "mvn clean test".
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Using Log4J on your classpath">
       <p>
         To use Log4j 2 in your application make sure that both the API and Core jars are in the application's
         classpath. Add the dependencies listed below to your classpath. 
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li><code>log4j-api-${Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar</code></li>
         <li><code>log4j-core-${Log4jReleaseVersion}.jar</code></li>
       </ul>
       <p>
         You can do this from the command line or a manifest file.
       </p>

      <subsection name="Using Log4J in your Apache Maven build">
       <p>
         To build with <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>, add the dependencies listed below to your 
         <code>pom.xml</code> file.

       <p>
         To build with <a href="https://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Apache Ivy</a>, add the dependencies listed below to your
         <code>ivy.xml</code> file.

      <subsection name="Optional Components">
        <p>
          Log4j 2.x contains several optional components that can be included in an application.
        </p>
        <h4>Log4j 1.x</h4>
        <p>If there are existing components that are written to use Log4j 1.x and it is desired to have this
           logging routed to Log4j 2 then remove any log4j 1.x dependencies and add the following.
        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j-1.2-api</artifactId>
    <version>${Log4jReleaseVersion}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependecies>
]]></pre>
          <h4>Apache Commons Logging</h4>
          <p>Commons Logging is used in many components as a way of letting applications choose the specific
             logging implementation. To route logging from those components into Log4j 2 include the
             following dependency and do not remove the Commons Logging jar.
          </p>

    <version>${Log4jReleaseVersion}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependecies>
]]></pre>
          <h4>SLF4J</h4>
          <p>SLF4J is another popular logging API that may be bound to Log4j 2 by including the following
             dependency along with the SLF4J dependencies.
